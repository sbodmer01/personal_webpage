Hi, hello! You've made it to my personal webpage. Not a lot to explain here other than the fact that I've written this code myself. I chose to stick to vanilla web dev practices so that I won't need to worry about dependencies or high level maintenance. 

Ok, that's all! Hopefully this is pretty straightforward.
